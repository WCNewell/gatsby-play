This sandbox app is deployed to: https://clarknewell-gatsby-sandbox.netlify.com 

Hello. So the story goes...I coverted https://clarknewell.tech to a child theme of WordPress Twenty Twenty in order to use that as a headless CMS for a Gatsby/React front-end, the progress on that is currently located in the repo clarkapp2-gatsby-source-wordpress and deployed at https://clarknewell.netlify.com , there are many things I have in store for the personal blog site including a burger menu and light/dark mode using React hooks. I found I was more confident in experimenting with a sandbox or play site than messing up the architecture of my actual site. Yeah, yeah, I know there is such a thing called git version control, and I do use it LOL, but still, a sandbox just gives a more psychological sense of freedom I guess. I'm glad that my styling aspirations are taking shape here and look forward to implementing them on on ClarkApp 2.
